# Electromagnetic inversion for permafrost/ground ice detection

The goal of the project was to build a program to invert synthetics EM data, in order to identify resistive layers that may correspond to permafrost, interstitial ice or buried ice. Using MATLAB, I developed a simple program that need only a few functions, which inverts the data at each measurement point. A large weight matrix connects the different measurement points and their physical characteristics allowing to apply a horizontal and vertical regularization.
