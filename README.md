# Bachelor Thesis - Anhorn Barthélémy

The goal of the project is to build a program to invert geophysical data collected in the pro-glacial domain, in order to identify resistive layers that may correspond to permafrost or buried ice. Using MATLAB, I built a simple program with only a few functions, which inverts the data at each measurement point into one dimension. A large weight matrix connects the different measurement points and their physical characteristics allowing to apply a horizontal and vertical regularization. To test my MATLAB code, I will quickly programme in python with the basic functions of simPEG and PyGimli some one-dimensional inversions. 

Tools : PyGimli, SimPEG, MATLAB
